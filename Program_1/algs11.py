Question 8’s graph is shaped similar to a normal distribution based on the probability specified, so for our citation
model, each node would approximately have 5 to 6 indegrees. The citation graph is much more similar to the Matthew graph.
 Another name for the Matthew type of graph is preferential attachment or ‘rich get richer’, so basically a node with
 more in-degrees will have a higher probability of getting even more in-degrees as new nodes are added to the graph.
 The nodes in the clique at the beginning will more likely become ‘hubs’ with the most indegrees, while the nodes at
 the end of the n-d list will have the least. Related to the citations, as people publish new papers, they will more
 likely cite older more popular papers, and new papers will get cited less because they are new and not as known in
 the field at first. Yes the citation graph is a good example of popularity as a network phenomenon, or the Matthew
 graph.
