- Divide and Conquer algorithm to locate the supermode element of a list
- Decrease and Conquer algorithm to locate the supermode element of a list
- Recommedation system: measure degree to which the rankings of a common set of movies by two people are similar or different
  - Ranking - list of movie ids, ordered from best to worst
  - System finds someone with similar rankings using a distance function, `d(r,s)`, where `r` and `s` are rankings of the same set of `n` movies from 2 individuals. 
  - Count number of inconsistencies in `s` with respect to `r` -> pair of ids `a` and `b` such that `a` appears before `b` in `r` but after `b` in `s`
